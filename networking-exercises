Networking exercises



Create a network for the subnet: 10.0.0.0/8

The network has 6 locations:
- 1. 128 hosts
- 2. 32 hosts
- 3. 30 hosts
- 4. 7 hosts
- 5. 6 hosts
- 6. 3 hosts

For every location find:
- the subnet + mask address
- broadcast address
- number of usable IPs
- range of usable IPs
- network address
- host address

Create a network for the subnet: 172.16.0.0/16

The network has 5 locations:
- 1. 1250 hosts
- 2. 140 hosts
- 3. 250 hosts
- 4. 6 hosts
- 5. 1 hosts

For every location find:
- the subnet + mask address
- broadcast address
- number of usable IPs
- range of usable IPs
- network address
- host address

Create a network for the subnet: 130.255.168.70

The network has 6 locations:
- 1. 1000 hosts
- 2. 2000 hosts
- 3. 6 hosts
- 4. 16 hosts
- 5. 127 hosts
- 6. 3 hosts

a)
- The first network connects with the third network with /30 (any IPs).
- The secound network connects with the fourth network with 172.16.200.200/29
- The fifth network connects with the sixth network with 172.16.200.248/30
- 1 with 2 with 172.16.100.7/28
- 1 with 4 with 172.16.64.28/24
- 1 with 5 with 192.168.0.0/30

b)
- With the exception of the first network all networks will be configured with DACP  

c)
- Configure the routing tables for every router in the network such that every network can communicate with all networks (for extra points make so that network 2 can not communicate with network 5 on a routing level)

d)
- Network 2 to have 3 PCs and 2 switches, 2 PCs in 1 switch and 1 PC in the other switch. Populate MAC address tables with all MACs from the network on PC and switches
